q
=

Quick and dirty debugging output for tired programmers.

Install q with "easy\_install q" or "pip install q".

To print the value of foo, insert this into your program:

    import q; q(foo)

Use "q/" to print the value of something in the middle of an expression
while leaving the result unaffected.  In this example, you can print the
value of f(y) without needing to put f(y) in a temporary variable:

    x = q/f(y) + z

To trace a function's arguments and return value, insert this above the def:

    import q
    @q

Output will appear in /tmp/q, which you can watch with this shell command:

    tail -f /tmp/q
